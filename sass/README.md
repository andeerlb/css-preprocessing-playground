# What SASS/SCSS support?

* [variables](variables.scss) # to store information that you want to reuse throughout your stylesheet
* [nesting](nesting.scss) # to let you nest your CSS selectors in a way that follows the same visual hierarchy of your HTML
* [modules](modules.scss) # You don’t have to write all your Sass in a single file. You can split it up however you want with the @use rule
* [mixins](mixins.scss) # A mixin lets you make groups of CSS declarations that you want to reuse throughout your site
* [inheritance](inheritance.scss) # Using @extend lets you share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another
* [operators](operators.scss) # Doing math in your CSS is very helpful. Sass has a handful of standard math operators
